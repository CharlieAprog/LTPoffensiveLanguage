# Is it offensive? Detection of offensive tweets using LSTM, Transformer and BERT

Project for the masters course Language Technology project at the University of Groningen.

Authors: Charlie Albietz, Panagiotis Ritas, Richard Fischer and Jan-Henner Roberg

We tested three different models for this project, to run the individual models simply run the corresponding python files:

LSTM.py

transformer.py

BERT.py

Disclaimer: The transformer implementation was taken from https://github.com/pbloem/former/tree/b438731ceeaf6c468f8b961bb07c2adde3b54a9f/former
